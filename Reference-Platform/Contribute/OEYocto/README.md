# Contributions to OpenEmbedded Reference Platform Build

OpenEmbedded Reference Platform Build layer descriptions and how/where to send patches.

## Layers

### OE-core (Base layer)

###### About

This is the main collaboration point when working on OpenEmbedded projects and is part of the core recipes. The goal of this layer is to have just enough recipes to build a basic system, this means keeping it as small as possible.

###### Contribute

Submit all patches through the OpenEmbedded Core Mailing list

https://lists.openembedded.org/mailman/listinfo/openembedded-core

### Meta-rpb (Distro)

###### About

This is a very small layer where the distro configurations live. Currently it houses both Reference Platform Build and Wayland Reference Platform Builds.

### Meta-oe

###### About

This layer houses many useful, but sometimes unmaintained recipes. Since the reduction in recipes to the core, meta-oe was created for everything else. There are currently approximately 650 recipes in this layer.
