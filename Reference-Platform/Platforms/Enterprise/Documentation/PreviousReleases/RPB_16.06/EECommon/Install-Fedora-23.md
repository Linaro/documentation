## Installing Fedora 23

This guide is not to be a replacement of the official Fedora 23 Installer documentation, but instead be a quick walkthrough for the network installer. You can find the original documentation at [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/AArch64/F23/Installation](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/AArch64/F23/Installation)

### Setting up the TFTP server

Back to your dnsmasq server (check [this link](DHCP-TFTP-Server-UEFI.md) for instructions on how to setup your own TFTP/DCHP server), download the required Fedora 23 installer files at your tftp-root directory. In this example, this directory is configured to `/srv/tftp`.

Downloading required Grub 2 UEFI files:

**Note:** Because of bug [1251600](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1251600), we need to use both `BOOTAA64.EFI` and `grubaa64.efi` from the Fedora 22 release.

```shell
sudo su -
cd /srv/tftp/
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/22/Server/aarch64/os/EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/22/Server/aarch64/os/EFI/BOOT/grubaa64.efi
```

Downloading upstream Kernel and Initrd

```shell
mkdir /srv/tftp/f23
cd /srv/tftp/f23
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/23/Server/aarch64/os/images/pxeboot/vmlinuz
wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/23/Server/aarch64/os/images/pxeboot/initrd.img
```

Creating the Grub 2 config file (`grub.cfg`):

```shell
menuentry 'Install Fedora 23 ARM 64-bit' --class fedora --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {
    linux (tftp)/f23/vmlinuz ip=dhcp inst.repo=https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/23/Server/aarch64/os/
    initrd (tftp)/f23/initrd.img
}
```

You should now have the following file tree structure:

```shell
/srv/tftp/
├── BOOTAA64.EFI
├── f23
│   ├── initrd.img
│   └── vmlinuz
├── grubaa64.efi
└── grub.cfg
```

Now just make sure that @/etc/dnsmasq.conf@ is pointing out to the right boot file, like:

```shell
dhcp-boot=BOOTAA64.EFI
```

### Booting the installer

Now boot your platform of choice, selecting PXE boot when presented by UEFI (make sure to boot with the right network interface, in case more than one is available).

You should see the following (using AMD Seattle's Overdrive as example):

```shell

```

At this stage you should be able to see the Grub 2 menu, like:

```shell
Install Fedora 23 ARM 64-bit
.
Use the  and  keys to change the selection.                       
Press 'e' to edit the selected item, or 'c' for a command prompt.
```

Now just hit enter and wait for the kernel and initrd to load, which automatically loads the installer and provides you the installer console menu, so you can finally install Fedora 23 (just make sure that target device has external network access, since the installer is downloaded automatically after booting the kernel).

You should see the following:

Starting installer, one moment...
anaconda 23.19.10-1 for Fedora 23 started.
 * installation log files are stored in /tmp during the installation
 * shell is available on TTY2
 * if the graphical installation interface fails to start, try again with the
   inst.text bootoption to start text installation
 * when reporting a bug add logs from /tmp as separate text/plain attachments
00:29:26 X startup failed, falling back to text mode

.
X was unable to start on your machine.  Would you like to start VNC to connect t
o this computer from another computer and perform a graphical installation or co
ntinue with a text mode installation?
.
 1) Start VNC
.
 2) Use text mode
.
  Please make your choice from above ['q' to quit | 'c' to continue |
  'r' to refresh]:

```

For the text mode installer, just enter `2` and follow the instructions available in the console.

Menu items without that are not `[x]` must be set. Enter the menu number associated with the menu in order to configure it.

### Finishing the installation

After selecting the installation destination, the partitioning scheme, root password and users (optional), just enter `b` to proceed with the installation.

Once the installation is completed, you should be able to simply reboot the system in order to boot your new Fedora 23 system.

### Automating the installation with kickstart
