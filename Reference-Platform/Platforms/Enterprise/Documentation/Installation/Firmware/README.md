EDK2 is a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the UEFI and PI specifications.

The reference UEFI/EDK2 tree used by the EE-RPB comes directly from [upstream](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2), based on a specific commit that gets validated and published as part of the Linaro EDK2 effort (which is available at [https://git.linaro.org/uefi/linaro-edk2.git](https://git.linaro.org/uefi/linaro-edk2.git)).

Since there is no hardware specific support as part of EDK2 upstream, an external module called [OpenPlatformPkg](https://git.linaro.org/uefi/OpenPlatformPkg.git) is also required as part of the build process.

EDK2 is currently used by 96boards LeMaker Cello, AMD Overdrive, ARM Juno r0/r1/r2, HiSilicon D02 and HiSilicon D03.

This guide provides enough information on how to build UEFI/EDK2 from scratch, but meant to be a quick guide. For further information please also check the official Linaro UEFI documentation, available at [https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/ARM/UEFI](https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/ARM/UEFI) and  [https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/LEG/Engineering/Kernel/UEFI/build](https://wiki-archive.linaro.org/LEG/Engineering/Kernel/UEFI/build)
