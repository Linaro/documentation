h4. Closed source binaries

** Git: "https://git.ti.com/wilink8-wlan/wl18xx_fw":https://git.ti.com/wilink8-wlan/wl18xx_fw
** Branch: *R8.5*
* Extra firmware files available from firmware-linux
* Mali (requires EULA)

h3. Downloading the pre-built binaries

The build is composed by the traditional Android image files (@boot@, @cache@, @system@ and @userdata@), but to avoid incompatibilities issues with older bootloaders, or different partition tables, it's also recommended to flash the bootloader.

*Bootloader files:*

bc. wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/aosp/hikey/15.10/bootloader/l-loader.bin
wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/aosp/hikey/15.10/bootloader/fip.bin
wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/aosp/hikey/15.10/bootloader/ptable-aosp.img
wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/aosp/hikey/15.10/bootloader/hisi-idt.py

*CE AOSP RPB image:*

bc. wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/aosp/hikey/15.10/boot_fat.uefi.img.tar.xz
wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/aosp/hikey/15.10/cache.img.tar.xz
wget https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/aosp/hikey/15.10/userdata.img.tar.xz

Since @system.img@ requires the user to accept an End User License Agreement covering the rights to download and use the proprietary Mali userspace driver, it needs to be manually downloaded via browser. Please go to "https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/aosp/hikey/15.10/system.img.tar.xz":https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/aosp/hikey/15.10/system.img.tar.xz and follow the instructions to download the file.

Uncompress the .tar.xz files using your operating system file manager, or with the following command, for each file:

bc. xz --decompress [filename].tar.xz; tar -xvf [filename].tar

h3. Flashing

h4. Bootloader

To flash the bootloader the recovery mode is required. For more information about the recovery mode, how to enable and use, please go to "https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/Reference-Bootloader-Hikey#enabling-recovery-mode":https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/Reference-Bootloader-Hikey#enabling-recovery-mode

On recovery mode, flash the bootloader with the following command:

bc. sudo python hisi-idt.py --img1=l-loader.bin -d /dev/ttyUSB0
sudo fastboot flash ptable ptable-aosp.img
sudo fastboot flash fastboot fip.bin

Change @ttyUSB0@ to the right interface name that gets exported to your host system.

Make sure to reboot the board after updating the partition table (@ptable-aosp.img@), otherwise flashing the system image might fail.

h4. Boot, System, Cache and Userdata

Fastboot is required to flash boot, system, cache and userdata.

Due bug "117 (UEFI fastboot uploads hangs for large images)":https://bugs.96boards.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117, it's recommended to flash the images via recovery mode (after running @hisi-idt.py@).

*Flashing boot, cache, system and userdata:*

bc. sudo fastboot flash boot boot_fat.uefi.img
sudo fastboot flash cache cache.img
sudo fastboot flash system system.img
sudo fastboot flash userdata userdata.img

Once flashed, make sure recovery mode is not enabled (pin3-pin4 on J15), then just reboot the board and enjoy :-)
