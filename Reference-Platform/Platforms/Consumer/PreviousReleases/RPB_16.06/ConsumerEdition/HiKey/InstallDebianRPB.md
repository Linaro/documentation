# Install Instructions - Reference Software Platform

This page provides download and installation instructions inteded for those interested in flashing the HiKey board with pre-built Linaro Reference Software. Two methods are currently available: **SD card method** and **Fastboot method**. If you are already familiar with these methods, you may find all necessary files in the [96Boards RPB 16.06 build folder](https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/debian/hikey/16.06/).

#### Step 1: Read about the SD Card Method

The SD card method allows you to place a microSD card into the HiKey to automatically boot and install the Linux Desktop onto the board. This method is generally simpler and should be used by beginners.

This method requires the following hardware:
- HiKey with power supply
- Host Linux machine (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows)
- MicroSD card with 4GB or more of storage
- USB Mouse and/or keyboard
- HDMI Monitor with full size HDMI cable


***
#### Step 2: Download SD Card Image

**Debian Linux Reference Software Platform - SD Card Image**

[SD Card Image - Direct Download](https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/debian/hikey/16.06/hikey-debian-jessie-alip-sdcard-*.img.gz)

***

#### Step 3: Prepare MicroSD card

- Ensure data from mircoSD card is backed up
- Everything on microSD card will be lost by the end of this procedure.

***

#### Step 4: Find SD Card Device name

- Use host Linux computer
- Open "Terminal" application
- Remove SD card from host computer and run the following command:
```shell
lsblk
```
- Note all recognized disk names
- **Insert SD card** and run the following command (again):
```shell
lsblk
```
- Note the newly recognized disk. This will be your SD card.
- You will need to remember this device name for a later step.

***

#### Step 5: Recall Download Location

- Locate SD card install file from Downloads page.
- This file will be needed for the next step.

***

#### Step 6: Unzip _SD Card Install Image_

- When unzipped, you will have a folder with the following contents:
   - Linaro/Debian Install Image (.img)
   - Readme

***

#### Step 7: Go to directory with _SD Card Install Image_ folder using Terminal

- Use host Linux computer
- Open "Terminal" application
- `cd` to the directory with your unzipped **SD Card Install Image**

```shell
cd <extraction directory>

#Example:
#<extraction directory> = /home/YourUserName/Downloads
#For this example we assume the "Debian SD Card Install Image" is in the Downloads folder.
cd /home/YourUserName/Downloads
```

***

#### Step 8: Install Image onto SD Card

**Checklist:**

- SD card inserted into host Linux computer
- Recall SD Card device name **Step 4**
- From within the extraction folder, using the Terminal execute the following commands:

**Execute:**

```shell
sudo dd if=hikey-jessie_alip_2015MMDD-nnn.img of=/dev/XXX bs=4M oflag=sync status=noxfer
```

**Note:**

- `if=hikey-jessie_alip_2015MMDD-nnn.img`: should match the name of the image that was downloaded.
- `of=/dev/XXX`: XXX should match the name of the SD Card device name from [**Step 2**](). Be sure to use the device name with out the partition.
- This command will take some time to execute. Be patient and avoid tampering with the terminal until process has ended.
- Once SD card is done flashing, remove from host computer and set aside for a later step


***

#### Step 9: Prepare HiKey with SD card

- Make sure HiKey is unplugged from power
- Connect an HDMI monitor to the HiKey with an HDMI cable, and power on the monitor
- Plug a USB keyboard and/or mouse into either of the two USB connectors on the HiKey
- Insert the microSD card into the HiKey
- Plug power adaptor into HiKey, wait for board to boot up.

***

#### Step 10: Install Linaro/Debian onto HiKey

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F18wlgU.png" data-canonical-src="https://i.imgur.com/F18wlgU.png" width="400" height="250"/>

- If **Steps 1 - 8** were followed correctly, the above screen should be visible from your HiKey
- Select the image to install and click “Install” (or type “i”). OS will be installed into the eMMC memory
- This process can take a few minutes to complete
- Upon completion, “Flashing has completed and OS has installed successfully....” message will appear.

Before clicking "OK":

- Remove the SD Card
- Now click "OK" button and allow HiKey to reboot.

**Congratulations! You are now booting your newly installed operating system directly from eMMC on the HiKey**

# Fastboot Method

***

#### Step 1: Read about the Fastboot Method

Fastboot is supported by the board and can be used for installs.  This is for advanced users who are most likely modifying/customizing source code and will need to download such updates to the board for test/execution.

This method requires the following hardware:
- HiKey with power supply
- Host Linux machine (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows)
- USB to microUSB cable
- USB Mouse and/or keyboard (not required to perform flash)
- HDMI Monitor with full size HDMI cable (not required to perform flash)

***

#### Step 2: Download Debian partition table

> Note: Some files have 4G and 8G options, download file which best matches your HiKey board.

- All HiKey **CircuitCo boards** will use the **4G files**
- All HiKey **LeMaker 1G boards** will use the **8G files**
- All HiKey **LeMaker 2G boards** will use the **8G files**

**ptable-linux.img** ([**4G Download**](https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/debian/hikey/16.06/bootloader/ptable-linux-4g.img) / [**8G Download**](https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/debian/hikey/16.06/bootloader/ptable-linux-8g.img))

***

#### Step 3: Download Boot image and Root File System

- **Debian Boot** ([**Download**](https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/debian/hikey/16.06/hikey-boot-linux-*.uefi.img.gz))
- **Debian Rootfs** (<a href="https://builds.96boards.org/releases/reference-platform/debian/hikey/16.06/hikey-rootfs-debian-jessie-alip-*.emmc.img.gz" target="_blank">**Download**</a>)

***

#### Step 4: Install Debian Using Fastboot with Linux host

This section show how to install the Linaro based Debian operating system to your HiKey using the fastboot method on a Linux host computer.



1 - **Make sure fastboot is set up on host computer**

- Android SDK “Tools only” for Linux can be downloaded <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk" target="_blank">here</a>
- The Linux “Tools Only” SDK download does not come with fastboot, you will need to use the Android SDK Manager to install platform-tools.
- To do this follow the “SDK Readme.txt” instructions included in your SDK “Tools Only” download.

If you are still having trouble setting up fastboot, <a href="https://youtu.be/W_zlydVBftA" target="_blank">click here</a> for a short tutorial video

2 - **Boot HiKey into Fastboot mode using J15 header**

- Link pins 1 and 2
- Link pins 5 and 6
- Connect host computer to HiKey board using USB to microUSB cable

Name | Link | State
---- | ---- | -----
Auto Power up | Link 1-2 | closed
Boot Select | Link 3-4 | open
GPIO3-1 | Link 5-6 | closed

- Power on HiKey board by plugging in power adapter
- Esure HiKey is detected by host computere
- Wait for about 10 seconds
- Open Terminal application and execute the following:

```shell
$ sudo fastboot devices
0123456789abcdef fastboot
```

>Note: If your HiKey is not being detected by fastboot, you might want to try [Board Recovery](https://github.com/96boards/documentation/blob/master/ConsumerEdition/HiKey/Installation/BoardRecovery.md) and return to this step once your board is ready

3 - **Install Operating System update using downloaded files**

>**NOTE:** the ptable must be flashed first. Wait for a few seconds after the reboot command to allow the bootloader to restart using the new partition table.

```shell
$ sudo fastboot flash ptable <ptable_FILE_NAME>.img
$ sudo fastboot reboot
$ sudo fastboot flash boot <boot_FILE_NAME>.uefi.img
$ sudo fastboot flash system hikey-rootfs-debian-jessie-alip-YYYYMMDD-nnn.emmc.img
```

4 - **Reboot HiKey into new OS**

- Wait untill all files have been flashed onto HiKey board
- Power down HiKey by unplugging the power adapter
- Remove microUSB cable from HiKey
- Remove Link 5-6 from J15 header

Name | Link | State
---- | ---- | -----
Auto Power up | Link 1-2 | closed
Boot Select | Link 3-4 | open
GPIO3-1 | Link 5-6 | open

- Plug mouse/keyboard USB into type A USB ports
- Power up HiKey by plugging in power adapter


**Note:** the **username** and **password** are both **“linaro”** when the login information is requested.

**Congratulations! You are now booting your newly installed OS directly
from eMMC on the HiKey!**
