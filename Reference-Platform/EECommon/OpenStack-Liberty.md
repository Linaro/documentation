# OpenStack Liberty - Debian Jessie

# Introduction

In general, the instructions in the Liberty install guide should be followed: https://docs.openstack.org/liberty/install-guide-ubuntu/overview.html.  This guide will describe changes to the documented procedures that should be kept in mind while going through the guide.

Each section below will correspond to a section in the guide.  Guide sections that do not have a corresponding section below may be followed as-is.

# Release Notes

## Configuring images for aarch64

An image must be configured specially in glance to be able to boot correctly on aarch64.  
To attach the devices to the virtio bus (which does not allow hotplugging a volume, but will work if the image does not have SCSI support), the following properties must be set:

```shell
--property hw_machine_type=virt
--property os_command_line='root=/dev/vda rw rootwait console=ttyAMA0'
--property hw_cdrom_bus=virtio
```

To attach the devices to the SCSI bus (which does allow hotplugging a volume, but might not be supported by the guest image), the following properties must be set:

```shell
--property hw_scsi_model='virtio-scsi'
--property hw_disk_bus='scsi'
--property os_command_line='root=/dev/sda rw rootwait console=ttyAMA0'
```

You can set these properties when you are uploading the image into glance, or modify the image if you have already uploaded it.


# Pre-Installation

## Verify/enable additional repositories

Verify that the `linaro-overlay` and `jessie-backports` repositories are enabled.

Check if they are available by checking `/etc/apt/sources.list` and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`.

If missing, add the following to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory:

```shell
$ echo "deb https://repo.linaro.org/ubuntu/linaro-overlay jessie main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/linaro-overlay-repo.list
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E13D88F7E3C1D56C
```

If missing, add the following to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory:

```shell
$ echo "deb https://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jessie-backports.list
```

## Modify repository priorities

Create `/etc/apt/preferences.d/jessie-backports`:

```shell
Package: *
Pin: release a=jessie-backports
Pin-Priority: 500
```

Then, make sure to run apt-get update:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
```

## Environment

Update `/etc/hosts` to add “controller” as an alias for localhost.

```shell
127.0.0.1       localhost controller
```

## Disable IPV6

Add the following to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```shell
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.eth0.disable_ipv6 = 1
```

Run sysctl to apply the changes:

```shell
$ sudo sysctl -p
```

# Following the Openstack guide...

OpenStack guide: https://docs.openstack.org/liberty/install-guide-ubuntu/overview.html

### Verify operation

The CirrOS image to run on aarch64 is the file that ends in `-uec.tar.gz`.  It must be extracted and each file (kernel, initrd, disk image) uploaded to Glance separately.

Download the CirrOS AArch64 UEC tarball and untar it:

```shell
$ wget https://download.cirros-cloud.net/daily/20150923/cirros-d150923-aarch64-uec.tar.gz
$ tar xvf cirros-d150923-aarch64-uec.tar.gz
```

Upload the image parts into Glance.  You will need to make note of the IDs assigned to the kernel and initrd and pass them on the command line when uploading the disk image:

```shell
$ glance image-create --name "cirros-kernel" --visibility public --progress \
  --container-format aki --disk-format aki --file cirros-d150923-aarch64-vmlinuz

$ glance image-create --name "cirros-initrd" --visibility public --progress \
  --container-format ari --disk-format ari --file cirros-d150923-aarch64-initrd

$ glance image-create --name "cirros" --visibility public --progress \
  --property hw_machine_type=virt --property hw_cdrom_bus=virtio \
   -property os_command_line='console=ttyAMA0' \
  --property kernel_id=KERNEL_ID --property ramdisk_id=INITRD_ID \
  --container-format ami --disk-format ami --file cirros-d150923-aarch64-blank.img
```

## Add the Compute service (Nova)

Ensure that vnc and spice are disabled in `/etc/nova/nova.conf`.  Look for the following keys in `nova.conf` and set them to False:

```shell
vnc_enabled=false

[spice]
enabled=false
```

Enable KVM by ensuring the following is in `nova-compute.conf`:

```shell
[DEFAULT]
compute_driver=libvirt.LibvirtDriver

[libvirt]
virt_type=kvm
```

**NOTE: Until kernel support for KVM is properly enabled, instances can be run in emulation by ensuring the following is in `nova-compute.conf`**:

```shell
[DEFAULT]
compute_driver=libvirt.LibvirtDriver

[libvirt]
cpu_mode = custom
virt_type = qemu
cpu_model = cortex-a57
```

**IMPORTANT: If you make changes to `nova.conf`, or `nova-compute.conf`, restart the nova services:**

```shell
$ sudo service nova-compute restart
```
